So, I didn't quite follow the structure that was given last class, since I had already started doing the assignment a couple of days before. I took an old CV I had, and I  basically tried to copy it in HTML and CSS. You can check the CV I used as a model, is the model.pdf that you can find in this folder. I tried to make the CV responsive, and it has 3 breaking points using media queries (For mobiles, tablets, and laptops/PC), you can resize the browser windows to see the effect.  <b>PLEASE</b>, don't worry if you don't understand something of this, since are topics that we still haven't covered in class, and is probably going to be part of furthers lessons. For the rest, if you have any questions, suggestions, recommendations, I am looking forward to get some feedback and/or inquiries.  Cheers, and see you, next class!
